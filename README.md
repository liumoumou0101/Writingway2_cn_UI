# Writingway 2
AI-assisted creative writing, scene planning, and worldbuilding in a local-first app.

Writingway 2 is a browser-based writing tool built for drafting fiction, organizing scenes, keeping worldbuilding notes close at hand, and working with either cloud AI providers or a local GGUF model.

## What Writingway does

Writingway is organized around projects, chapters, scenes, and compendium entries.
It gives you:

- A scene-first editor for drafting and revising
- Chapter and scene organization with reordering
- A compendium for characters, locations, lore, items, and other story notes
- AI-assisted drafting, rewriting, brainstorming, and workshop chat
- Writingway 1 project import
- Local project save/export tools
- Optional backup flows
- Optional local GGUF inference through llama.cpp

## Highlights

- Local-first writing workflow
  Your projects live in IndexedDB while you work, and can also be saved to disk as project files.

- Flexible AI setup
  Use OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, NanoGPT, LM Studio, custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, or a local GGUF model via llama.cpp.

- Built-in local GGUF setup flow
  If Writingway detects a `.gguf` file in `models/` but no llama.cpp server, it can offer an in-app setup wizard to install llama.cpp for you.

- Backups
  GitHub Gist backup is supported, and local versioned backups are supported through the app server. OneDrive and Google Drive are listed in the UI but are not implemented yet.

- In-app update staging
  Writingway can detect newer builds, download an update, stage it locally, and apply it the next time you restart from the launcher.

## Requirements

### All platforms

- Python 3
- A modern browser

### Optional for local GGUF mode

- A `.gguf` model placed in `models/`
- llama.cpp server files in `llama/`
  Or let the app install them through the setup wizard when supported.

## Quick start

### Windows

1. Download and extract the project.
2. Double-click `start.bat`.
3. Open Writingway in the browser window it launches.

### Experimental desktop app

This fork also includes an experimental Electron desktop shell. It starts the local app server and updater service, then opens Writingway in a desktop window instead of a browser tab.

Requirements:

- Node.js and npm for development

Run the desktop shell:

```bash
npm install
npm run desktop
```

Create an unpacked desktop build:

```bash
npm run pack
```

Create Windows distributables in `release/`:

```bash
npm run dist
```

If Electron Builder downloads are unstable on your network, run this first in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:ELECTRON_BUILDER_BINARIES_MIRROR='https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron-builder-binaries/'
```

The desktop build serves the app through Electron's built-in Node runtime, so end users do not need Python for the desktop app. Local GGUF model startup remains handled by `start.bat` for now.

### macOS / Linux

1. Download and extract the project.
2. Run:

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

3. Open Writingway in the browser window it launches.

## First-run local AI flow

If you already placed a `.gguf` model in `models/`:

- Writingway checks whether llama.cpp is installed
- If it is missing, Writingway can show a setup wizard
- The wizard can install a supported llama.cpp build
- After installation, restart Writingway from `start.sh` or `start.bat`

If you do not want local AI, just skip the wizard and use an API provider instead.

## AI modes

### API / Local API

Use this for:

- OpenRouter
- Anthropic
- OpenAI
- Google AI
- NanoGPT
- LM Studio
- Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- Ollama if exposed through a compatible API layer

This is the best choice if you want the simplest setup.

### Local GGUF Model

Use this only when both are true:

- You have at least one `.gguf` file in `models/`
- llama.cpp server files are installed in `llama/`

Writingway hides this option when the local backend is not actually available, so users are less likely to end up in a broken configuration.

## Launchers and local services

The launchers do a few important things for you:

- Start the Writingway app server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Start the updater service on `http://127.0.0.1:8001`
- Start llama.cpp on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` when local GGUF mode is available
- Apply staged updates on the next start

Use the launcher scripts instead of opening `main.html` directly.

## Saving and backups

### Manual project save

The disk save button writes the current project snapshot to the `projects/` folder through the local app server.

### Local versioning backup

Writingway can create timestamped JSON backups in:

```text
project-backups/
```

This gives you local restore points without needing a cloud account. The current fork adds:

- Local backups enabled by default when the local server or desktop shell is available
- Custom backup folder selection that is remembered between launches
- Retention by count, by age, or keep-all, plus a cleanup action
- Automatic safety snapshots before project or scene restore
- A local recovery center for backups found on disk
- Pinned backup versions, editable backup notes, and storage summaries
- JSON backup export/import for moving a backup between installs
- Scene-level compare and restore, including paragraph-level diff highlighting

### GitHub Gist backup

Writingway can back up a project to a private GitHub Gist if you provide a GitHub token with `gist` scope.

### Not implemented yet

These appear in the backup provider selector, but are not functional yet:

- OneDrive
- Google Drive

## Updates

Writingway compares the latest GitHub commit date on `main` with the local build date in `src/update-checker.js`.

If a newer build is available:

- Writingway can download and stage the update
- You restart Writingway manually
- The launcher applies the staged update on startup

On Windows and Linux/macOS, the staged update is applied by `start.bat` or `start.sh` on the next launch.

## Writingway 1 import

Writingway includes a Writingway 1 importer for older projects.
It can bring over project structure and content so you can continue working in Writingway 2.

## Project structure

A few important folders:

```text
models/           Optional GGUF model files
llama/            Optional llama.cpp server files
projects/         Manual project saves written by the app server
project-backups/  Local versioned backups
tools/            Local Python services
src/              App source
```

## Development notes

This repo includes a small test setup in `package.json`.
Available scripts:

```bash
npm run smoke
npm run unit
npm run ui
npm test
```

## Current status

What is working now:

- Writing and scene management
- Compendium/worldbuilding
- AI provider configuration
- LM Studio integration
- Local GGUF mode through llama.cpp
- In-app llama.cpp setup flow on supported platforms
- Manual project save to disk
- Local versioned backups
- GitHub Gist backup
- Update detection and staged update download

What is intentionally incomplete:

- OneDrive backup
- Google Drive backup
- Fully automatic restart/apply after update download
- Broader local installer coverage for every llama.cpp release variant

## Troubleshooting

### Writingway opens but local GGUF mode is unavailable

Check that:

- A `.gguf` file exists in `models/`
- llama.cpp is installed in `llama/`
- You restarted the launcher after installation

### The browser says it cannot connect on startup

Use the launcher scripts, not `main.html` directly.
The launchers wait for the local app server before opening the browser.

### Update downloaded but nothing changed

Restart Writingway using `start.sh` or `start.bat`.
The staged update is applied by the launcher on startup.

### Backups are enabled but cloud providers are missing

Only GitHub Gist and Local Versioning are currently implemented.
OneDrive and Google Drive are placeholders in the UI for future work.
